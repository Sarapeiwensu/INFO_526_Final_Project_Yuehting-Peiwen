# Description of dataset

This is a secondary analysis of an existing dataset using data obtained from [Kaggle, Cardiovascular Disease dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset). The dataset contains 70000 records and 13 features which were collected at the moment of medical examination, such as systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and having cardiovascular disease or not. 

# Import the dataset
```{r}
# ENTER YOUR CODE HERE
cardiodisease <- read_csv("data/cardio.csv",
                          col_names = TRUE,
                  col_types = "iifiiiiffllll")
summary(cardiodisease)
```

# Data preprocessing

First, drop missing value in the dataset. The columns of ap_hi and ap_lo stand for systolic and diastolic blood pressure which are impossible in the negative. So, filtering the dataset by the highest blood pressure in the world (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7741618/) and people who have hypotension. And based on the blood pressure measurement, differentiate ap_hi and ap_lo into 5 categories in categorical type. Convert the age in days into the age in years and then change the data type from float to integer. Create a new feature called BMI, calculate the body mess index of each record. Based on the BMI, creating a new feature called BMI_level to distinguish BMI into 4 categories: underweight, normal, overweight, and obese and the BMI_level feature is in categorical type. 

```{r}
# Drop missing value in the dataset
cardiodisease <- drop_na(cardiodisease)

# Filtering out impossible records
cardio_cleaning <- cardiodisease %>%
  filter(ap_hi <=370,ap_lo <=360,ap_lo >= 60, ap_lo <=360)

# distinguish systolic and diastolic into 5 categories: normal, prehypertension, 
# stage 1, stage 2, and hypertension crisis
cardio_cleaning <- cardio_cleaning %>%
  mutate(blood_pressure = 1)
for (i in 1:length(cardio_cleaning$ap_hi)) {
  if(cardio_cleaning$ap_hi[i] >= 180 && cardio_cleaning$ap_lo[i] >= 120 ){
    cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure[i] <- "hypertension_crisis"
  } else if (cardio_cleaning$ap_hi[i]>= 140 || cardio_cleaning$ap_lo[i] >= 90) {
    cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure[i] <- "stage_2"
  } else if (cardio_cleaning$ap_hi[i]>= 130 || cardio_cleaning$ap_lo[i] >= 80) {
    cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure[i] <- "stage_1"
  } else if (cardio_cleaning$ap_hi[i] >= 120 && cardio_cleaning$ap_lo[i]<80){
    cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure[i] <- "hypertension"
  } else {
    cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure[i] <- "normal"
  }
}
cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure <- as.factor(cardio_cleaning$blood_pressure)


# Change data type
cardio_cleaning$age <- cardio_cleaning$age / 365
cardio_cleaning$age <- as.integer(cardio_cleaning$age)

# Create a new feature called BMI
cardio_cleaning <- cardio_cleaning %>%
  mutate(BMI = weight / ((height/100) * (height/100)))

# Create a new feature called BMI_level
cardio_cleaning <- cardio_cleaning %>%
  mutate(BMI_level = "normal")
for (i in 1: length(cardio_cleaning$BMI)){
  if(cardio_cleaning$BMI[i] < 18.5){
    cardio_cleaning$BMI_level[i] <- "underweight"
  } else if (cardio_cleaning$BMI[i] <= 24.9 && cardio_cleaning$BMI[i] >=18.5){
    cardio_cleaning$BMI_level[i]<- "normal"
  } else if (cardio_cleaning$BMI[i] <= 29.9 && cardio_cleaning$BMI[i] >= 25){
    cardio_cleaning$BMI_level[i] <- "overweight"
  } else{
    cardio_cleaning$BMI_level[i] <- "obese"
  }
}

cardio_cleaning$BMI_level <- as.factor(cardio_cleaning$BMI_level)



# The dataset we used for analyzing
cardio <- cardio_cleaning %>%
  select(-height, -weight, -ap_hi,-ap_lo,-id)

summary(cardio)
```


# First Visualization

```{r}
# Barplot
bloodpressure_cardio <- cardio %>%
  group_by(cardio, blood_pressure) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
print(bloodpressure_cardio)



bloodpressure_cardio %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= blood_pressure,
             y = reorder(count,blood_pressure),
             fill = cardio))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge")+
  scale_fill_colorblind()+
  labs(title = "Distrubution of level of blood pressure with cardio disease",
       caption = "Dataset from Kaggle",
       x = "Level of blood_pressure",
       y = "count")+
  theme_linedraw()

```


This barplot shows the distributions of levels of blood pressure people whether who have the cardiovascular disease or not. For hypertension, people don't have the disease more than having the disease. For hypertension crisis, people in this category are in the fewer proportion of the dataset. Most people in the hypertension crisis category have cardiovascular disease. Of the people with stage 2 hypertension, 78% (18295/23477) people have the disease. Of people in the normal group, 78% don't have the disease. 


# Second Visualization

```{r}
# Pie Chart
piechart <- cardio %>%
  group_by(cardio,BMI_level) %>%
  summarize(count = n())

piechart$cardio <- as.factor(piechart$cardio)
print(piechart)

PieDonut(piechart, 
         aes(cardio, BMI_level, count = count),
         title = "Cardio disease: mobidity by level of BMI",
         titlesize = 5,
         r0 = 0.45,
         r1=0.9
         )
  

```

The piechart shows that people who have a normal level of BMI are more likely not to have the disease. Also, this piechart clearly shows the actual percentage of each category and the relationships between cardio disease and levels of BMI.


# Third Visualization

```{r}
cardio %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = age,
             fill = blood_pressure))+
  geom_density(alpha = .5)+
  facet_wrap(~cardio)+
  labs(title = "Density distribution of cardio disease cross levels of blood pressure")+
  theme_linedraw()

```

Based on the visualization, people who have cardiovascular disease across all the levels of blood pressure are distributed in the range of age from the 50s to 60s. People don't have the disease, the group of hypertension crisis distributed in older ages compared to other groups.
